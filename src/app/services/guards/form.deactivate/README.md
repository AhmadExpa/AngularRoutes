The reason why `snackBarRef.onAction().subscribe()` and `snackBarRef.afterDismissed().subscribe()` are written **outside the `Observable` brackets** is because they are **asynchronous event handlers**. They listen for specific events (either user interaction or timeout) and respond accordingly. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

### Observable Structure

In the `formDeactivateGuard` example:

```ts
return new Observable<boolean>((observer) => {
  const snackBarRef = snackBar.open('Are you sure you want to leave? Unsaved changes will be lost.', 'Yes', {
    duration: 5000,
  });

  // Event listeners for the SnackBar actions
  snackBarRef.onAction().subscribe(() => {
    observer.next(true); // Allow navigation when the user clicks 'Yes'
    observer.complete();
  });

  snackBarRef.afterDismissed().subscribe(() => {
    observer.next(false); // Block navigation if the snackbar times out or is dismissed
    observer.complete();
  });
});
```

### Why is this outside the `Observable`'s inner code?

1. **`Observable` Creation and Subscription**:
   - The `new Observable<boolean>((observer) => { ... })` block creates an observable that is waiting for some event to decide whether to navigate away (`observer.next(true)`) or stay on the page (`observer.next(false)`).
   - Inside this function, we define logic for how to complete the observable based on SnackBar's behavior.

2. **`snackBarRef.onAction().subscribe(...)`**:
   - This listens for when the **user clicks** the action button ("Yes" in this case) on the `MatSnackBar`.
   - Once the user clicks, it triggers the subscription's callback function, where we call `observer.next(true)` to tell Angular to proceed with the navigation.

3. **`snackBarRef.afterDismissed().subscribe(...)`**:
   - This listens for when the `MatSnackBar` is **dismissed**. Dismissal can happen when:
     - The SnackBar reaches the end of its timeout (in this case, 5000ms).
     - The user dismisses it by clicking elsewhere or it disappears automatically.
   - When the SnackBar is dismissed (and the user has not clicked "Yes"), we call `observer.next(false)` to block navigation.

### Why are these subscriptions (event listeners) placed outside?

- **Asynchronous Behavior**: 
   - These are asynchronous event listeners that don't immediately trigger. They need to "wait" for either a click on the "Yes" button or for the SnackBar to be dismissed. 
   - The code **inside the `Observable`** block sets up the subscriptions for these events.
   - The `observer.next(true)` or `observer.next(false)` only runs **once the respective event occurs** (clicking the button or dismissing the SnackBar). So, instead of blocking execution (which is how synchronous code behaves), we subscribe to these events and handle them asynchronously.
  
- **Non-blocking Nature**: 
   - JavaScript is non-blocking and uses an event-driven model. The `subscribe()` method doesn’t execute the event handler immediately. It just sets up the event listener, and once the event happens (the user clicks "Yes" or the SnackBar times out), the handler gets invoked.
   
### Why is this important?

- If the event listeners (`snackBarRef.onAction()` and `snackBarRef.afterDismissed()`) were **inside** the main `Observable` code block (which is synchronous), they would get executed immediately when the `Observable` is created, instead of **waiting** for the user’s actions. This would defeat the purpose of showing a SnackBar and letting the user decide.

---

### Visualizing the Process:

1. **SnackBar Opens**: 
   - `snackBar.open()` creates the SnackBar and displays it to the user.
   - The observable waits for either of two possible outcomes (action click or dismissal).

2. **User Interaction**:
   - The user **clicks "Yes"** → `snackBarRef.onAction()` triggers → `observer.next(true)` is called, allowing navigation.
   - The user does **nothing**, and the SnackBar **times out** → `snackBarRef.afterDismissed()` triggers → `observer.next(false)` is called, blocking navigation.

By keeping these event listeners outside the immediate synchronous execution path, we allow Angular to wait for the user's response before making a decision about navigation.

### In Summary:

- The code outside the `Observable`'s immediate body (the event subscriptions) is there to handle **asynchronous events**. These events (the user clicking a button or dismissing the SnackBar) will happen **later**, and we respond to them by calling `observer.next(true)` or `observer.next(false)` when they occur.
- **Inside the `Observable` body**, you set up how the SnackBar behaves (i.e., showing it and waiting for user input), and the `subscribe()` methods for `onAction()` and `afterDismissed()` handle specific asynchronous interactions.

Does this clarify the concept?
