In Angular, the **`<router-outlet>`** is crucial for navigating between different views (or components) in both the root and child routes. When you define child routes (like in the `home` route in your example), the **`<router-outlet>`** acts as a placeholder to display the child route's content within the parent component's view.

### Why You Need `<router-outlet>` for Child Routes
When you have **child routes** under a parent route, the parent component needs a place to display the content of the child route. That's where the **`<router-outlet>`** comes in:

1. **Parent-Child Structure**: In your example, `home` is a parent route, and `{ path: ':roomId', component: BookingComponent }` is a child route. When a user navigates to `/home/123`, the `HomeComponent` is shown, but Angular needs a way to display the child `BookingComponent` inside the `HomeComponent`. The **`<router-outlet>`** inside `HomeComponent` is where the child route's content (i.e., `BookingComponent`) will be rendered.
   
2. **Dynamic Content Display**: Child routes often represent dynamic or nested views that should be shown inside a parent view. For example, you might want to load different content based on the `roomId` inside the `HomeComponent` without navigating away from the parent view. The **`<router-outlet>`** makes this possible by loading the content dynamically.

### Example in Your Case

```ts
{
  path: 'home',
  component: HomeComponent,
  children: [{ path: ':roomId', component: BookingComponent }],
}
```

When navigating to `/home`, the `HomeComponent` will be displayed. If you go to `/home/123`, Angular will load the `BookingComponent` inside the `<router-outlet>` defined in the `HomeComponent`. 

So, without `<router-outlet>`, Angular would have no way of knowing where to display the child component (`BookingComponent`) within the `HomeComponent`.
